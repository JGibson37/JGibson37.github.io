              <p>About Me</p>
              <p> I am a young software developer looking for opportunities to grow my language base and knowledge pool.
                My first introduction to programming was self taught. I working with a bot that was designed to play the game, 
                Diablo II, for me. Once I got into highschool I ended up joining the FIRST Robotics team. Every year, the company
                FIRST Robotics, releases a video that describes a game played by robots. They are designed and programmed with

                    <p>
                      Codey Vs. Coder was the final capstone project of my cohort that my team desgined. It is a game where you
                      debug the code of an annoying AI who thinks he is all that. It has a back end API that reads questions from
                      a .txt file and uploads them. Using Javascript it injects different code into Iframes to render questions
                      onscreen in an exciting way. This project was the robust, encompassing everything I learned, and was the most 
                      fun project overall even though it was such high-pressure.

                    <p>Artists, Albums, Songs was my introduction project to HTML javascript and single page web design. While complicated
                      at first, the power of HTML javascript became apparent. Pulling information from the API we created, we go from a list
                      of all the Artists, to a view of the artist and all of their albums. From there we could then view the album and all
                      of the songs on the album. We added the functionality to create, and delete, artists and albums.

                      My personal portfolio project was a project started about halfway through my cohort, but became an
                      ongoing project for the rest of the cohort. Long after my portfolio was due I continued to make changes
                      and improve the look of my portfolio until what you are seeing now. Here is just some of the code I wrote
                      to bring this project to life.

                      I completed a trio of well known java katas. FizzBuzz, Triangle Sorter, and Babysitter. Because they are so known, 
                      I also robustly committed to github after every change, to ensure I captured my real work process. Below I've
                      shown a sample of the Triangle sorter, which was one of my favorites.

                      very heavy on OOP, inheritance, and polymorphism.
